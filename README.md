**\*** - _Hyperskill does not issue certificates for some courses if they have been completed by a small number of people or if they are considered to be in beta. However, you can see their completion in the [Hyperskill Profile](https://hyperskill.org/my-learning/37419592)_
**\*\*** - _Courses for which I can officially get a certificate, I just haven't requested it yet. I'll add a little later._
